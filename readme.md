# Matrix GPT
## Introduction
In this project we Implement a GPT model following the research paper "Transformers are all you need" and Andrej Karpathy’s “Let’s Build GPT” series on Youtube. Our source text is the script of the movies "The Matrix" and "The Matrix Reloaded". We train the model on this text and then generate new text based on the trained model.
## Example Output
Without sufficient resources we will not get perfect results. But here is an example of the output generated by the model trained on a free google colab GPU.
